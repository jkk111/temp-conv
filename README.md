# temp-conv
Temporary media conversion and hosting platform

# Setup
Run index.js with 
```
node index.js
```

This will create a file **admin.js**

Modify the username and password in this file and re-run the server.
Now navigate to: 
```
http://<INSERT_IP_ADDRESS>
```

Can also be run on https by place the files root.crt, ssl.crt and ssl.key in the same directory, then the server will run on https instead!
